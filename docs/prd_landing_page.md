# Landing Page AgéntiCo - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Generate 50+ qualified leads per month** from PyMEs with $5K+ automation budgets
- **Establish market positioning** as Colombia's first "agéntico development" company
- **Educate the market** about agéntico development vs traditional development
- **Demonstrate enterprise-grade capabilities** accessible to PyMEs
- **Create credible differentiation** through BMAD-METHOD™ and 15 years experience
- **Convert 8-12% of visitors** into leads through compelling value proposition
- **Generate $200K+ monthly pipeline** from landing page traffic

### Background Context

The Colombian PyME market represents a **$180M USD annual opportunity** in process automation, with 78% of companies still operating manual processes susceptible to automation. Only 12% have implemented custom solutions, creating a significant gap between rigid SaaS ($500-2K) and traditional development ($25K+).

Our agéntico development approach using BMAD-METHOD™ can deliver enterprise-grade solutions in 4-8 weeks vs 12-20 weeks traditional, at 40-60% lower cost through AI efficiencies. This creates a unique market position targeting distribuidoras, professional services, and light manufacturing (50-500 employees) in Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali.

The landing page must communicate this value proposition while educating a market unfamiliar with "agéntico development" as a category, positioning us as the democratizing force bringing enterprise capabilities to underserved PyMEs.
